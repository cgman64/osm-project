MAPZEN CUSTOM EXTRACT
https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/your-extracts/b79ce2ce8e0f

The map area I chose contains parts of the Bronx, Manhattan, 
Queens, and Brooklyn. Relatively speaking my map has a higher 
representation of Bronx Manhattan and Queens than Brooklyn in 
my extraction. I wanted to focus on the tri-borough area more 
specifically. I am interested in what insights and problems in the 
dataset can be found through database querying. The map also contains 
a small portion of area in New Jersey due the method of extraction.
